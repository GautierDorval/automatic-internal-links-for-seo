# Automatic Internal Links for SEO

Automatic Internal Links for SEO is a WordPress plugin that automatically inserts internal links based on predefined keywords.

It applies deterministic linking rules to ensure consistent internal site structure without relying on probabilistic or AI-driven behavior.


## Purpose

Internal linking is essential for crawlability, semantic clarity, and content discoverability.
On large sites, manual linking becomes inconsistent and difficult to maintain.

This plugin exists to standardize internal linking using explicit rules defined by the site owner.


## Core behavior (high level)

– Automatically creates internal links based on configured keywords.
– Uses deterministic rules, not AI or inference.
– Does not rewrite or rephrase content.
– Operates transparently within existing content.


## What this plugin is not

– Not an AI-powered linking system.
– Not a content optimization engine.
– Not a ranking guarantee.
– Not a full SEO suite.
